    * Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.
    * Variables defined with let have Block Scope.
  * const (ES6)
    * Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
    * Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
    * Variables defined with const have Block Scope.
* Data Types
  * JavaScript has dynamic types.

    * unary + operator
  * Converting Numbers to Strings
    * `String()`
    * `x.toString()`
  * Converting Dates to Numbers
    * `Number(new Date())`
    * `new Date().getTime()`
  * Converting Dates to String
    * `String(Date())`
    * `Date().toString()`
  * Converting Booleans to Numbers
    * `Number(false)`
    * `Number(true)`
  * Converting Booleans to Strings
    * `String(false)`
    * `String(true)`
    * `false.toString()`
    * `true.toString()`
* Functions
* Strings and String methods
  * String literal
  * String object
  * Using comparator operator `==` and `===`
  * `slice(start, end)`
  * `substring(start, end)`
  * `substr(start, length)`

  * Numbers are Always 64-bit Floating Point
  * JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.
  * Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.

  ```JS
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  let z = x + y;
  ---
  let x = "10";
  let y = "20";
  let z = x + y;
  ---
  let x = 10;
  let y = "20";
  let z = x + y;
  ---
  let x = "10";
  let y = 20;
  let z = x + y;
  ---
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  let z = "The result is: " + x + y;
  ---
  let x = 10;
  let y = 20;
  let z = "30";
  let result = x + y + z;
